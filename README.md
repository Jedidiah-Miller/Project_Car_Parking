# Project Car Parking

# Important things:
### this was for the first round interview
They reviewed my code and determined that it was worthy of a phone interview. 
During that interview I spoke with someone on the phone for about 40 minutes,
and during those 40 minutes I heard a motorcycle, or multiple mortorcycles, drive by.
At first I thought that there's no way that was a motorcycle that I just heard, super clearly and loudly, 
because that would be super rude and unprofessional of the interviewer,
but it happened so many more times that I was confident that if I started recording,
I would surely capture the motorcycle noise many more times.
I did of course capture the motorcycle noise at least 5 times after that,
as well as some little kids screaming in the background.


## How to
- this is using python3
- in the root project directory:
```
$ python3 .
```


### build an run on linux ?

```
$ sudo apt-get python3


```
